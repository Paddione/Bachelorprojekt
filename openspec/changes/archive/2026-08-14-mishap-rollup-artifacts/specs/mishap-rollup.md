## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Mishap rollup generates compliant change per run

The mishap rollup generator (`scripts/factory/mishap-rollup.sh`) SHALL produce a plan-only change
under `openspec/changes/` on a per-cycle branch named after the cycle slug
(`mishap-incident-rollup-<suffix>`), and that change SHALL pass OpenSpec validation. The generator
SHALL create the change artifacts itself: a `.ticket` file containing the container ticket ID and
a `specs/<slug>.md` delta that lists the bundle's findings as `ADDED Requirements` — the bundle
has no parent SSOT spec and is archived with `--create-new`.

#### Scenario: Change directory passes openspec validation

- **GIVEN** the rollup generator runs with fresh batch comments on the container ticket
- **WHEN** the resulting change directory under `openspec/changes/mishap-incident-rollup-<suffix>/`
  is committed
- **THEN** the OpenSpec validation tests SHALL pass
- **AND** `.ticket` SHALL exist with the container ticket ID
- **AND** `specs/` SHALL exist with a delta file named after the cycle slug

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Container description SHALL not claim permanence

The rollup container ticket created by `scripts/ticket.sh rollup-container` SHALL NOT describe
itself as permanently open. Its description SHALL state the ephemeral lifecycle: the container
collects one batch and is closed (`done · resolution=obsolete`) after the generator has consumed
it.

#### Scenario: Fresh container description states the ephemeral lifecycle

- **GIVEN** no open rollup container exists
- **WHEN** `scripts/ticket.sh rollup-container --brand <brand>` creates a new container
- **THEN** the ticket description SHALL NOT contain a claim of permanent openness
- **AND** the description SHALL mention that the container is closed after its batch is processed
